##What is it?

A light-weight (and thus not feature-complete) request-builder for [WPS-requests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Processing_Service).  
It focuses on execute-request, in order to reduce the complexity of the client.  
this means that you - the developer - have to know:

  - which processes are available and
  - which inputs the single processes expect.
